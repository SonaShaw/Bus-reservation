    <h3 style="color:white">History</h3>
    <p style=color:thistle>Until recently, the prevailing view assumed
         lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin,
          though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,”
           Before & After magazine answered a curious reader,
         “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which
          letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks
           pretty real.”

        As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”</p>

    The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
     consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin because in its youth,
     centuries ago, it was Latin.

Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College,
 is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text.
  In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum.
